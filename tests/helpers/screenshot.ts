/**
 * Opens `url` in the browser `page`, and takes multiple screenshots of the
 * page in the configured browsers.
 *
 * @remarks
 *
 * Two sets of screenshots are taken for each configured browser.
 *
 * The first set consists of 1 screenshot capturing the full page at whatever
 * height is necessary to show all the content.
 *
 * The second set consists of 1-N screenshots; the viewport size is set to
 * a reasonable size for the device, a screenshot is taken at the top of
 * the page, and the browser goes down one page. If going down a page shows
 * more content a new screenshot is taken. This continues until the entire
 * page has been captured in potentially multiple screenshots.
 *
 * @param page - The browser page to use.
 * @param url - The URL to screenshot.
